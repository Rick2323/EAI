The reception staff were really helpful in givin us directions etc. There is a minimart, subway and starbucks just across the road which is convenient. Also just off the walk of fame is a shopping mall with shops like Gap, Superdry, etc. There are also a few restaurants there as well. For anyone who likes pizzas I would recommend visiting the California Pizza Kitchen at the mall - pizzas are lush there and are rasonably priced. We got a shared bus to the hotel through Super Shuttle. It cost approx $-- return and pick ups occur every ----- mins from airport. Be warned of the way they drive tho, it was a slightly frightening experience after -- hours on a plane! \nWe didnt have a car there so did all organised tours, one through VIP tours and one through Starline Tours. The VIP tour was a tour of LA including Hollywood, Venice Beach, Downtown LA and Beverly HIlls. This lasted approx --- day and was really worth the money.

Took orange line from Midway, got off at the Library stop and short walk to hotel. Right across the street is a Ginos so if you need your fill of Chicago deep dish, Ginos is there to assist. \nThe hotel is quaint. Older buildings which have been merged to house the rooms. Very good service from check in to check out. At night, a bar is beside the lobby area with comfortable seating. Very relaxing space. As for the room, I was a large room with a King bed. Clean. The bed was very comfortable with crisp linens. Decor was fresh. View out of the window was the brick wall of the building next door. Did not bother me as I was only in the room to sleep and do some end of the day work. The bath was also very good size with a walk in shower....very nice. Another reviewer noted the rain head for the shower and low pressure. I will take the other side of the commentary. The pressure in the shower was very good and I loved the oversized rain head. If you did not like the downward stream, you could direct it slightly to get more of a traditional shower experience. I liked it so much, I am adding one to my soon the be remodeled bath. The only negative about the shower was the caulking had some mold.

The concierge was very helpful and we had a few ideas where we wanted to dine the last night and Eataly was great experience. She suggested it for a unique experience over the hotel restaurant. \nMost of all - the staff went above and beyond. Jordan was so awesome - he handled our check in (room wasn't quite ready, so he had us relax in the lounge while he handled check in) and he risked life and limb during an epic thunderstorm on our -nd day to score us a taxi to get to an appointment on time. \nI will not think twice when booking my next hotel in NYC - Hyatt -- Lex is terrific hotel and excellent value.

The city view was perfect although I must say Philly skyline looks better in the day than night. Their free breakfast was really like a mini-buffet, notice I did not say continental. It was really huge, or at least larger than other hotel chain's continental breakfast. I don't eat pork and I was able to get cheese eggs. The free internet was crazy fast. Checking in and out was a breeze. The entire staff was very helpful and I would stay again. \nThe Bad - I arrived -:-- (-- mins early) although check-in is -pm. I didn't mind the room was not ready then but was bothered that it was not ready until -:-- (-- mins late). The heater is not central based meaning you have to control it yourself and the vent was extremely loud. I opted many times to just not run it because it was just too loud to sit through. \nThe Ugly - After coming in one night, there were people hanging out next to the elevator and wall with no shoes on. I assume they were maybe taking a break from their room however the hotel does have a lobby for that. It was not a good site to see shoe-less guests hanging out on the wall and at the elevator. On my last night, I was awaken at -am by rude guest who had been [--] the entire trip. After going back to sleep, I was then awaken by hammering. The hotel is renovating a little. I was also charged for local calls after being told they were free. During check-out, I told the front desk and was given not only a free room for the hammering but no charge for the local calls.",

The lift was very nice and oppulent but dark, once up to the --th floor, we were met with a very dark, slightly creepy in a nice way corridor. This hotel must have just been renovated because everything was immaculate.\nOur room was a surprise, it was quite big and even though the decor was a little busy, we did like it, the bathroom was large, with good qaulity fixtures. The bath towels and robes were light and fluffy and the tioletries were replaced everyday. The soaps they use a lovely too, and WOW what a great shower. \nThe room itself had a very large flat screen TV mounted on the wall, we also had a floor to ceiling mirror on one wall and floor to ceiling windows. The bed was super-king size and the bed was very comfortable. As we are super fussy on bed quality we did make sure the beds were pillow-top and it was like a big marshmellow.\nAll the fixtures and fittings, looked to be brand new. Be warned though as some of the mini bar items, water, ect, snacks are placed on the tray with your glasses and cocktail shakers and they are not free. \nWe did have room service once and it was good and reasonably priced. We ate at Bin-- for breakfast a few times and found it very nice indeed.\nThere is a new Bar called The Crimson Lounge, gosh this place looked like a Vampire's Lure, very gothic, red and so dark, you could hardly see the person sat next to you on some tables. It was very busy on the weekend we where there, with lots of young girls aged around -- - --, dressed to impress, not our cup of tea really.\nWe did like Chicago, not so much as NY but we managed to see lots of sights. \nHarry Carays is a nice Bar ect. We also at at SMith and Wollensky but to be honest the over bearing waiter really put ut off. \nALl in all the Sax is very well placed in the Marina, right next to the House Of Blues, were you can watch blues and eat good food, we managed to go on Sunday for the Brunch and gospel Choir, was fantastic and en experience. \nOur only gripe was our view out of the windows, of the Corn Cob Towers, the car park hosts the first -- floors, so being on floor --, we had a view of the spiral car park and also the noise. \nHowever all in all it was a great hotel and well worth the money.",

On the other hand, the location near the convention center and other restaurants and shops is ideal for those who like to walk and explore during their trips. (Tip: Listen to the SD natives who kind of look askance when the idea of visiting Old Town is the topic. We didn't take their advice and ended up being seriously underwhelmed by Old Town and its surroundings. Instead, visit Coronado Island if you have a free afternoon during your conference. Those few hours along the beach and walking through the town on a sunny afternoon were the most memorable and pleasant of all during our SD stay.)

Grand Central Station is a short walk and gets you to other places you can't get to by walking (cheaper than yellow cabs - although you should also give this a go. We booked a cab with the hotel to take us back to the airport upon our departure and we got a limo - what a way to leave New York! This was certainly better than our inward travel. Got a transfer just outside the airport and spent -- minutes driving between terminals collecting other fares before arriving back at our original terminal and heading off to our hotel.\nOur room was on a top floor high which was great as it meant less traffic and street noise. We had some problems with the heater in our room but the reception staff eventually resolved this by providing us with a portable heater.\nWe did not eat at the hotel at all because diners and deli's are available in close proximity. The best meals we found were in China Town and at Planet Holywood. If you are planning to go to Planet Hollywood negotiate a travel within the main section of the restaurant before being shown to your table otherwise you may end up like us on the top floor overlooking the action and not in it.\nWe took part in typical tourist activities such as Ripleys and the CSI Experience. Disappointed with both unfortunately. Had hoped to see a broadway play but we left it to late and the only available tickts were $--- each. If you ant to get to the to of the Empire State bilding would suggest going early as the queue by mid-day will take at least an hour. The boat trips around New York are great and the best way to see the Statue of Liberty, The Brooklyn Bridge etc.\nMake sure you book the ---- Memorial at reception. Although very emotional it gives you a true understanding of the events which took place and an appreciation for life and the spirit of New Yorkers.\nThe store window displays, Xmas trees and ice skating rings are just amazing over Xmas. Ice skating on Xmas Eve on Xmas day was definetely a highlight and the Hot Chocolate with marshmallows and whipped cream is wonderful. Do be careful if paying for a padlock for the lockers. I forgot where ours was and soehow managed to gain access to someone elses ;-(\nStumbling across Times Square one evening whilst taking a stroll was enlightening literally. All of a sudden he colour of the sky was bright. There are so many illuminated signs and this area has a real buzz at night time. Didn't care too much for the hoards of people here during the day though.\nWe did use the hotel bar on our last evening. The bar man was nice and friendly. The bar room was a little odd and resembled a chapel or such like.\nWe were surprised at just how many people there were and how many shops remained open on Xmas day. This really is the town that does not sleep.\nOur only regret was not having longer than - days but there is always next time.",

It's just dirty.\n-. The coffee maker in the room was broken - it made --- cup of coffee and then turned off. So if you want a full cup, you have to ask it - times. Of course, by then the cup is almost all cold. Good luck making tea with it, if you don't like ice tea.\n-. Once we have used the provided tea packs, room service didn't bother to replace them. Probably saved them a cent or so.\n-. There's no free internet access in the business center and no free printing. I am staying in various hotels a lot and wasn't used before to being charged dollar-a-minute for printing a simple page of driving directions. I was used to getting it for free, as it was in most hotels of this class I visited. Hilton, however, decided to save yet another ---- of a cent.\n-. Most hotels provide some sort of paper for the guests to write on. Hilton has post-it notes. Literally - tiny squares of paper, and that's it. If you want to write down something that's not - words - good luck, Hilton is not going to help, go find an Office Depot and buy it yourself. Here, another cent saved for Hilton. \n-. Parking pricing is outrageous - I've parked cheaper in San-Francisco downtown, no discounts or anything for hotel guests - but don't expect that to mean easy and convenient parking. Parking lot is crammed, and spending -- minutes looking for a random place somebody didn't notice, or trying to fit your car into the space that nobody dared to use because it's too small - is routine. All while a bunch of spaces stay empty - but general public is not allowed there, probably so that they can charge you ---% for valet parking in the same spot, in addition to the outrageous price paid for the parking - which a lot of hotels of this class provide for free. In Hilton, I not only got charged for it - I got charged twice in one of the days. They can't even make their system work properly.\nSummarily, the personnel of the hotel was very nice, welcoming and pleasant. They did what they could. However, the hotel itself fell below the expectations - I paid more than I expected to pay for less than I expected to get from Hilton. I understand the economy is tough and everybody has to save, but saving on a couple of sheets of paper and a couple of tea bags is too much for me. When I go to a brand-name hotel like Hilton I don't expect that. After this stay I would think twice - no, a dozen times - before ever staying at a Hilton establishment again.

            "original": "I very much wanted to stay at a boutique hotel near Times Square in lieu of a Hilton or Marriott type. After some research, hubby and I compromised on The Paramount after seeing the price of their modern chic rooms on the website. When we checked in we were both excited about the impressive lobby. Very us. BUT we were royally disappointed when we entered our King Deluxe room. Womp womp womp...\nI'm normally a very flexible-laid back, go with the flow gal but this just wasn't what I was expecting at all.\nThe pictures seemed to be photo shopped bright and welcoming on the website. In reality, the room was entirely too small and the bathroom lacked a lot of luster. The room just seemed so dark and small. Just NOT what we had in mind for our - night NYC experience. The money spent renovating this hotel was obviously poured into the more public areas of the hotel. The closet would better be described as a compartment to store ~- jackets so our suitcases took up the little floor space we had.\nWe headed downstairs and explained our concerns and requested upgrade options. I inquired about their Entertainment and Couture suites displayed on their website as they are the only ones displayed. Do you know what they told me?! The available suites displayed on their website are only used for corporate events and fashion shoots. I was dumbfounded. I encouraged them to provide keys to the suite that they DO have available for purchase so that I can see it before we accept the upgrade for an additional $--- for our - nights in NYC. We saw it and it was another womp womp womp. They had simply take a wall and corned off - rooms at the end of the hallway. Even the rooms still had the heavy secure hotel door separating the bedroom from the living room AND the exit sign still existed in the cornered off wasted space in the entrance of the suite. The bedroom in the suite had a double bed. My husband and I are very tall and we by no means intend to share a double bed while paying for a suite. Desperately trying to see the positive, I looked out the window to see if our view had been upgraded. View from Times Square? It had been a bit but a partial view of lights from Times Square and the back of a billboard just wasn't worth it to me. Womp womp womp.\nWe headed back downstairs, handed them the suite key and stated that we will only be spending - night at The Paramount and would be checking out the following day. (Obviously, it was too late to cancel our room that night and not pay a fee, etc.) The customer service was very kind so I hadnâ€™t the heart to share my disappointment. I'm sure it was obvious by our actions at that point.\nI've attached a picture of my hubby stretching out his hands so that you get an idea of just how small the King Deluxe room is. Note our luggage covering the entire opposite side of the bed. No point in showing you the view out the window, it was the back of a building.\nIf you care to know:\nNYC was insanely booked everywhere last week. We did manage to secure - nights at The Bowery (LOVED it, ---% guarantee that we will return) and the - other nights of our trip were spent at the Marriott on Times Square with an incredible view of Times Square.",

We went to breakfast and returned at --:-- and were told that our room was still not ready. We waited another ninety minutes and checked back with the front desk and were told that they would put a rush on our room with housekeeping, that they were in the process of cleaning it, and to come back in a half an hour. We did, and the room still wasn't ready. By that time we were both exhausted and perhaps the front desk person took pity on us and upgraded us to a junior suite. \nThe room was quite large especially for New York hotel rooms. We had views of the street from two sides, which we enjoyed, but it was noisy. It didn't bother us, but I think it would wake up a light sleeper. The bed was comfortable and the reading lights had dimmers. The desk was large and had a power strip.\nWe chose this hotel over the other InterContinental in New York City because of the price, location, and previous reviewer's glowing comments. There were a few little details that just didn't compare with previous experience we've had with this hotel brand.\nThe furniture looked a bit shabby with scuff marks on the table and tired looking furniture, chipped paint. The bathroom had a light fixture hanging loosely from the ceiling. There was some mold on the ceiling in the shower area. There were a couple of times that I had to wait over five minutes for hot water in the bathroom and the bathroom sink had a constant drip. One of our towels had a large hole in it. I know it sounds like nit-picking, but I've become accustomed to a certain level of expectations when staying at an InterContinental hotel, and for the reasons above, the Barclay didn't meet those expectations, in my opinion.",

The woodwork outside our room was so battered looked as if someone had been hacking at it with an ax. \nOn the positive side, I liked the overal design of the room, and the bedding was of nice quality. But there were some serious flaws. The bathroom cabinet was cracked so severely that some of the wood veneer had copletely fallen off. And, although I asked for a nonsmoking room, the place smelled strongly of smoke. We are not smokers and didn't spend any time with smokers during our trip, but our clothes absorbed the smell from the room. When we got home and unzipped our suitcases, the smell of smoke was extremely strong. I had to dryclean the brand new overcoat that I had just purchased that very weekend at Saks.\nOther positives about this hotel are the location. It was very convienient to Magnificent Mile shopping and attractions. The cafe attached served great coffee, and I never waited more than a couple of minutes for my order.
