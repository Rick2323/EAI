{"original":{"happy":[{"id":10404,"description":"This is a great small hotel in the city. It is in a slightly quieter part about - minutes from -th Avenue, which is quite a relief after a full day in the city. The rooms are spacious for a small hotel with high ceilings. I would recommend avoiding rooms at the back of the hotel where we were as there is a pretty noisy air conditioning unit. The staff are very friendly and we can strongly recommend the restaurant. The steak is exceptional and the service equally good. We would definitely stay again.","browser":"Opera","device":"Desktop","label":"happy"},{"id":10405,"description":"my husband and i stayed here a few years ago, so i can't vouche for now, but it was a great hotel. it was sleek and stylish. the room was very small, but we expected that and the AC was noisy....\nother than that it was GREAT","browser":"InternetExplorer","device":"Desktop","label":"happy"},{"id":10407,"description":"My wife and I recently stayed at the Henderson's Wharf Inn and we definitely enjoyed our stay. The room was spacious, the beds were very comfortable, but the room could have had more light. We kept our shades closed because our room was on the ground level (as are all the rooms) and we did not want walker-runners along the pier peering into our room. But, our view from the room of the harbor was lovely.\nService: There could be more front desk staff. During our stay, it seemed like the young lady working the front desk was extremely busy and she was the only person at the front desk working until the next morning. Inspite of this, she provided great service. The bottle of wine upon check-in is a nice touch.\nFood: the continental breakfast was fantastic and was one of my favorite aspects of the hotel. The continental breakfast offered nice variety and the fool was delicious. The woman who tended to the breakfast was friendly and efficient; she provided great service.\nValue: Truly, the only issue I had with the hotel was the price. It's an expensive hotel for what one receives. My wife and I have been fortunate to travel and stay in some great hotels worldwide and it seems in our travels; we have experienced more for what we paid for at other hotels than what we paid for at the Henderson's Wharf Inn. The Henderson's Wharf Inn is a nice hotel and I will recommend it, but it could add something more.","browser":"Firefox","device":"Tablet","label":"happy"},{"id":10410,"description":"Stayed two nights with DH at this excellent hotel. Platinum upgrade to a gorgeous suite - even the bathroom had a hallway! Comfortable bedding, swank sitting area, spotless bathroom with Bliss products. Common rooms were gorgeous - loved hanging out in the lobby to play checkers, or a drink I guess. We were there during a very quiet time when the rooftop club was closed so room on the --th floor was ok, otherwise staff said they put guests wanting a quiet room on the -th floor so try to book that ahead of time. Location was perfect if you want to visit Hollywood Boulevard sites (you can just walk out the door), Griffith Park, Laugh Factory, and the Hollywood sign are a short drive away.","browser":"Edge","device":"Desktop","label":"happy"},{"id":10411,"description":"This was the most amazing one nighter I have ever experienced! From the moment we got there we felt like Royalty. The staff was exceedingly friendly and so very helpful. Jose Rosales answered every question we had. We got there early and they stored our luggage for us while we walked to the Alamo. When we got back we were shown to our room which was simply put, HUGE. We were able to upgrade to a suite and was worth every penny. That evening we were able to host some friends for after dinner drinks. Thank you so much Hyatt, Jose and the rest of the staff for making us feel welcome and comfortable.","browser":"Firefox","device":"Desktop","label":"happy"},{"id":10412,"description":"i stayed at this hotel in mid-August for work, our conference was in the hotel. i found the different floor motifs to be quite amusing! I was on the --th floor, and i do recommend if you are at all superstitious to let them know at check in that you prefer a different floor! my room was nice, and clean, but it was one of their smaller rooms with just one queen bed. It was nice and the bed was very comfortable, i had no problem sleeping. But if i was paying for the room myself, or if i was staying longer, i would have preferred a larger room, because although nice & cozy, it would be too cramped for a longer stay. all in all, a nice place very convenient location.","browser":"InternetExplorer","device":"Desktop","label":"happy"},{"id":10414,"description":"We travel for work and I'm constantly looking for new and intersting places to stay. The Inn at The Black Olive was perfect. I didn't feel like I was stuck in another hotel but rather staying somewhere fun and relaxing. The location was amazing and the beds are really comfortable. The restaurant upstairs was excellent. Everyone was really nice and helpful. i only had a few thoughts that weren't totally positive, but they in no way will keep me from staying there every time we're in Baltimore for work. The TV in the living room was on the smaller side. As I don't watch TV a lot that doesn't really matter to me. There was no dock or stereo hookup for an ipod. Would have been nice, but again, I wasn't there to just sit in the room for hours. They only carried glass bottles for water. I get why for sure but it would have been nice to have something more easy to carry outside the hotel. Maybe have water bottles in the room that they can charge for?","browser":"Google Chrome","device":"Desktop","label":"happy"},{"id":10415,"description":"we paid well over the odds for this hotel but found it a greation location, only across the road from Macy's.

Location cannot be faulted, short walk to the subway, Times Square and the theatres on Broadway. Our room had a kingsize bed and was on the --th floor it faced the back of the hotel, it was extremely quiet and the view was good. The room was very spacious and much larger than I thought it would be having read some previous reviews. It was also in good decorative order. Yes the bathroom was quite small, but just how much time do you spend in a bathroom when there's so much to see and do in New York. Housekeeping was excellent.\nThe price represented excellent value for money and this comes from someone who never books anywhere without first checking up on tripadvisor.","browser":"Edge","device":"Mobile","label":"happy"},{"id":10417,"description":"I stayed here for a seminar and wasn't expecting much. After all, you are pretty much locked in to this location. I wouldn't recommend commuting o McCormick Place on a daily basis... \nAnyway the hotel was very clean, staff was attentive and always friendly (they even told us how to get free Internet). The room was clean and modern but the highlight of the entire stay was the shower! Holy cow this thing had pressure and was instantly hot! It was like our own private spa! \nOverall a great place to stay and the hotel was clean, close to the city activities and the only real option if you're in town for a convention.","browser":"Mozilla","device":"Desktop","label":"happy"},{"id":10418,"description":"I had stayed the Elysee's sister property the Casablanca in June and really liked it and decided to try the Elysee because of the location in midtown. This was going to a quick -- hour trip from LA to NYC so I e-mailed the hotel ahead of time and requested a room at the back of the hotel as I'm a very light sleeper, and with the trip being so short I was really hoping they would me able to accommodate me. I had booked a deluxe king room. While checking in I was told that I had been upgraded to a one bedroom suite at the back of the hotel. I felt like reaching across the counter and planting one on the nice young man! I was escorted up to my suite and absolutely giddy with delight as this never happens to me. The suite was spectacular! The living room was very large for NYC standards and had a plasma tv in the armoire. The bedroom was equally large and spacious and the bathroom was done in marble. I only wished my stay was to be longer than -- hours.\nThe complimentary breakfast can be delivered to your room for only $-. I called and requested this service in the morning and it was brought immediately up which consisted of a large pot of coffee, bagels, and fruit. I tipped the deliveryman and dug in! I couldn't believe what incredible service I was getting. \nThe wine and cheese in the evening was generous and relaxing. The free wi-fi in the room was also very much appreciated.\nWhat sets the Elysee apart is the staff. Each request or inquiry was met with a professional response. The hotel is boutique style so its very intimate and the staff addresses you on a first name basis, making it feel like home. \nI travel to NYC quite a bit for business and pleasure and I have tried them all, but this will be my new home away from home. The abundant complimentary breakfast, wine and cheese and free wi-fi make the Elysee such a great value. And no, its not cheap, but what is in NYC? If you add in the complimentary services and the fantastic staff the Elysee simply can't be beat. And thanks again to everyone who made my stay so effortless. Only wish I could have stayed in the suite for a week!","browser":"Firefox","device":"Desktop","label":"happy"},{"id":10420,"description":"My wife and I stayed at the Lucerne with our two boys (-- and --) for three nights last week (April ----). The room (two double beds) was small, but not an issue for us as we were not in the room except to sleep. The lower cost is worth the trade-off in space. The hotel was clean and the staff was friendly. The neighborhood is great fun. We enjoyed being in an area where people live. Places to eat (especially breakfast), Central Park, and the museums were within easy walking distance. The subway stop was on the same block as the hotel, and on a line convenient to many of the sites you would want to see. We went to Times Square one night and were glad to have a quiet area to return to. Overall, the Lucerne is a great place to stay and see the city.","browser":"Edge","device":"Desktop","label":"happy"},{"id":10421,"description":"I stayed in this hotel for - nights, and have no reason for any complaints at all.

We booked via the hotels website, and got a rate of $--- (plus taxes) for the standard room. it was well-equipped (video player, CD, kitchnettett, safe). We stayed on the --th floor, and our room facing --th Street was a bit noisy, with the - AM garbage truck, ---- police sirens and what have you, so if you are sensitive, you might want to chose a room facing the back. Otherwise the hotel was flawless: the desk downstairs, amenities, cleaning, the bed, everything just perfect (and we are pretty fuzzy). Free wireless in the comfortable business center (but a charge of $-- if you want it in your room). Faboulus value for the location and standard. Highly recommended.

I found it! I love how cozy the place feels; the lobby reminds me of an old country inn. The room was spacious and especially liked the seating area next to the bed. Had breakfast and must say that this place has the best waffles. The buffet had everything you need to start your day. Especially great is the complimentary business center where I was able to use the internet and print my boarding pass all at no charge. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I was pleased and would absolutely stay here again. Did not use the pool but it looked inviting and those using it seemed very happy.","browser":"InternetExplorer","device":"Mobile","label":"happy"},{"id":10427,"description":"A great location just off the Magnificent Mile on Illinois, almost at the dividing line between The Loop and the Magnificent Mile. My wife and I stayed here and could walk to the northernmost tip of The Mile and as far south Millennium Park. All staff including front desk, valet, breakfast staff and cleaning staff were outstanding. Our room was a king suite with seperate dining area, living room and bedroom. In wall safe was an appreciated item. I requested an inside room, not fronting Illinois, to reduce exposure to the fire trucks screaming out of the fire hall next door. Noise was not a problem. Rate was around the $--- a night mark, great value for this gem.","browser":"Google Chrome","device":"Mobile","label":"happy"},{"id":10430,"description":"An excellent hotel - for business or pleasure. The location is excellent - very close to Time Square. First about reaching here - you are much better of using the taxi or the group airport van to arrive here from JFK or Newark airports. Dont go for the 'avoid the traffic and use the train' !! Or else you could be in Penn Station in -- minutes (incl -- mins just to reach the station on the airports) but waiting for cabs over there for the next --. \nThe hotel itself is great. But if you are planning to arrive early and put some luggage in the hold, remember that they charge you like $- per day or so - which is really pittance but not free (thankfully they waived it off for me).

Because of the funky W styling, there are a set of shutters in a window that seperates the bathroom from the sleeping area. If you're traveling with a companion, this would not allow for much privacy, but if you're traveling alone it enables you to see the view of the lake while you're literally standing in your shower. \nThe lobby bar area is fun, but seemed to close rather early.","browser":"Firefox","device":"Tablet","label":"happy"},{"id":10435,"description":"We were in Chicago for a wedding with friends.
